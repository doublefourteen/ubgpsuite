\(em filter and print BGP data within MRT dumps
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
@UTILITY@ \fB[\fIOPTIONS\fB]\fR... \fB[\fIFILES\fB]\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR @UTILITY@
utility reads each possibly compressed Multithreaded Routing Toolkit
(MRT)
Routing Information Base
(RIB)
file specified by
.IR FILES ,
and extracts information related to PEER INDEX TABLE
records.
.IR @UTILITY@
processes and formats such records according to the options specified by
.IR OPTIONS .
.IR @UTILITY@
prints diagnostics to standard error,
it detects and tolerates data corruption as much as possible.
If data corruption cannot be tolerated, the entire MRT dump file is dropped,
.IR @UTILITY@
will then move to the next file in
.IR FILES ,
if any.
.P
Such events are always reported with reasonable diagnostic errors.
.P
See the
.IR EXAMPLES
section below for usage examples.

.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:

.IP "\fB\-r or \-\-only\-refs\fP" 10
By default
.IR @UTILITY@
writes all PEER INDEX TABLE entries, this option causes
.IR @UTILITY@
to only print peers that are referenced by RIB entries.

.IP "\fB\-h or \-\-help\fP" 10
Prints a short help message, summarizing
.IR @UTILITY@
functionality.

.IP "\fB\-?\fP" 10
Equivalent to
.BR \-h .

.SH "LINE ORIENTED OUTPUT"
.IR @UTILITY@
splits each PEER INDEX TABLE record into multiple lines, every line represents a peer.
Note that
.IR OPTIONS
may cause some peers inside PEER INDEX TABLES to be discarded (See the
.IR OPTIONS
section for details).


Each peer is formatted as the following `|' separated fields:
.RS 4
.sp
.RS 4
.nf

PEER ENTRY|ASN32BIT
.fi
.P
.RE
.P
Fields have the following meaning:

.IP "\fBPEER ENTRY\fP" 4
The peer entry inside PEER INDEX TABLE, displayed as `peer\-address peer\-asn'.

.IP "\fBASN32BIT\fP" 4
May be either 1, if the peer AS number was encoded within 32 bits, or 0 otherwise.
.P
Note that this flag being 0 does not necessarily imply that the peer does not have
ASN32BIT capability, it is merely an indicator of how the peer entry was encoded within
the PEER INDEX TABLE record (namely, it only used 2 octets to encode its ASN).
.P
.RE

Multiple PEER INDEX TABLES are concatenated within the output, meaning that
the same peer appearing in multiple PEER INDEX TABLE records may appear twice in
.IR @UTILITY@
output.

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The following exit values are returned:
.IP "\00" 6
All input data was scanned successfully,
and data was written to output correctly.
.IP >0 6
Errors were detected in input data, write error occurred,
or an unrecoverable error occurred (such as out of memory errors).

.SH STDIN
The standard input is used only if no
.IR FILES
arguments are provided, or when any of the specified
.IR FILES
arguments is `\-' , in which case MRT data is read from standard input at that
point, up to an <end\-of\-file>.
.P
Whenever
.IR @UTILITY@
reads from standard input, MRT data is assumed to be uncompressed.

.SH "INPUT FILES"
.IR @UTILITY@
supports most MRT dump formats as written by the majority of Route Collecting
projects (see the
.IR STANDARDS
section below for additional references).
MRT dumps may be provided either in their plain uncompressed form, or
as files compressed by
.IR gzip (1),
.IR bzip2 (1),
or
.IR xz (1).
.IR @UTILITY@
performs appropriate decompression on the fly.
File extension is used, in a case insensitive way, to discriminate among
supported compression formats. If the file extension is not recognized,
or there is no extension, then it is assumed to be uncompressed.

.SH STDOUT
The standard output is used to print a human readable text representation of
PEER INDEX TABLE contents, nothing else shall be written to the standard output.
.IR @UTILITY@
may detect and treat as error whenever the standard output is a regular file,
and is the same file as any of the
.IR FILES
arguments.
The default output format used by
.IR @UTILITY@
is documented in the
.IR "LINE ORIENTED OUTPUT"
section.

.SH STDERR
The standard error is used only for diagnostic messages and error reporting.

.SH EXAMPLES
This section contains some useful examples, demonstrating basic
.IR @UTILITY@
usage.

.IP \[bu]
The following is the simplest way to invoke
.IR @UTILITY@ :
.nf
\&
.in +2m
@UTILITY@
.in
\&
.fi
It formats and prints all peers inside the uncompressed MRT
RIB input data it receives from standard input.

.IP \[bu]
The following command:
.nf
\&
.in +2m
@UTILITY@ -r
.in
\&
.fi
formats and print only peer entries referenced by at least one RIB entry
inside the uncompressed MRT RIB input data coming from standard input.

.IP \[bu]
The following is equivalent to the previous example:
.nf
\&
.in +2m
@UTILITY@ -r ./rib.1.bz2
.in
\&
.fi
but takes MRT input data from a
.IR bzip (1)
compressed file.

.IP \[bu]
The following is equivalent to the previous example:
.nf
\&
.in +2m
@UTILITY@ -r ./rib.*.gz
.in
\&
.fi
but takes MRT input data from multiple
.IR gzip (1)
compressed files resulting from the glob expansion.
Most likely the command output is going to
contain data coming from multiple PEER INDEX TABLES,
peers may appear more than once.

.IP \[bu]
The following command:
.nf
\&
.in +2m
@UTILITY@ ./rib.*.gz
.in
\&
.fi
is similar to the previous example, but does not remove
unreferenced peer entries from output.
